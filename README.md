# browser-based-models-tfjs
This is a repository for the classifier models produced using TensorFlow.JS for Coursera's 'TensorFlowJS: Data and Deployment' course. The majority portion of the codes have been provided by Laurence Moroney, available at https://github.com/lmoroney/dlaicourse. I completed the missing parts of the codes and uploaded them here for practice purpose.
The contents are as follows:
1. Week 1 consists of a breast cancer prediction model. It was trained to classify between malignant or benign- two types.
2. Week 2 consists of a fashion mnist classifier model.
3. Week 3 has a binary image classifier model.
4. Week 4 has 5 class (Rock-Paper-Scissor-Spock-Lizard) image classifier that learns from being trained on live webcam images.
All these codes and models are for training and running on the browser.
